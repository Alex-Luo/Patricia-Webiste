                At the sunset of our temporary lives on earth, we embark on a most wondrous soul passage in our return to the Great Beyond, the eternal spirit realms from which we come. As a Soul Passage Midwife, I have had the honor of accompanying many souls from all walks of life across the threshold and through the spirit realms since 1993...

              <div id="intro" class="blog-content">
                <p class="description">
                  I hope this website inspires the reader to learn more about the beautiful and profoundly loving return journey awaiting us.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                  In 1993 when my mother was ready to make her soul passage, I had never been in a room with someone dying and had no idea what to expect. Regardless, my soul was able to accompany my mom's soul across the threshold and through the spirit realms, bringing great joy to each of us. I believe it is the natural order of things for families to escort their loved ones at this pivotal moment in life. The sojourn with my mother was the first of what I call Soul Passage Midwifery. This deep experience is recounted in the interview with Maria Dancing Heart Hoaglund and one with Richard O. under "Interviews" on this site.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                  Befriending the soul passage is a joyful exploration. Please consider that when going to a foreign country, we gleefully research the language, customs, etc. Once we have a better understanding, the joy of the new ways inspire us and give us new perspectives on the world in which we live. Similarly, when we understand the different ways of the Great Beyond, we find that there is nothing to fear and everything to celebrate.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                  Further, suppose that since returning home, there has been no opportunity to use the eagerly acquired foreign language for ten years. When suddenly thrust into a situation requiring the language, a beautiful flow of words in the foreign language simply emerges. Likewise, when thrust into a situation where the ways of the Great Beyond are required, remembering rushes forward. The potential for conscious awareness resides in each one of us. For the loved one crossing the threshold and for the family, amazing doors of wonder can and do open.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                  Education, experience and spiritual awareness help to bridge the gap between our lack of understanding and the true beauty of returning to our spiritual Home. In other words, we need to talk about these things so we can move beyond our limiting beliefs. My book, "Song of Sight: An Introduction to Soul Passage Midwifery," (2017), describes many soul passages and gives recommendations for others wishing to explore this fascinating topic. Please click the "Book" tab above.

                <p class="description">
                  The International Association of Near Death Experiences (IANDS), has made wonderful progress in bringing deeper understanding of near death and related experiences. One can listen to many, many people who have personally experienced the profound love of the spirit realms. My presentations with IANDS are available under "Interviews," on this site. To learn more about IANDS go to <a href="https://www.IANDS.org" target="_blank">https://www.IANDS.org</a>. Wishing you a wondrous adventure of discovery.

              <h2 class="title">The Unfolding of a Soul Passage</h2>
              <p class="description">
                Reframing our understanding of death allows each of us to take a bold evolutionary step forward. I believe that what is most inspiring is that we come to see the thoughtfulness and tenderness of the unfolding of a soul passage that our culture would have us fear...

                  Each soul experiences a unique passage within which there may be common elements such as stairs or fog. My sojourns into the Light have all been beautiful, gentle, profoundly loving and deeply welcoming.

                <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">Entering the Path of the Unknown</h4>
                <p class="description">
                  Realizing that "our time" has come is generally a surprise to almost everyone. It seems too soon no matter the age of the one preparing to pass. Those who can gracefully accept the reality of the moment and focus deliberately with conscious awareness seem to have a smoother experience. Yet, even the most non-accepting ones among us eventually remember the profound beauty.
                </p>
                <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">Guide for the Soul</h4>
                <p class="description">
                  Every soul has a guide for the soul passage at hand. This guide can answer questions, accompany the soul and provide insights. Every care is taken to make this process gentle and loving. A Soul Passage Midwife or family member can take the role of the spirit guide through expanding conscious awareness to be present on earth and in the spirit realms.
                </p>
                <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">Life Review</h4>
                <p class="description">
                  The life review is a self-assessment by the soul. Each soul comes to earth to learn certain things and to share gifts large or small with humanity in a loving manner. This self-assessment allows the soul to know how he or she has met the tasks of life on earth. The life reviews that I have attended were breathtaking. Souls who have amends to make or healing to do have options available to them.
                </p>
                <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">Soul Emergence</h4>
                <p class="description">
                  The emergence of the soul from the body is unquestionably a rare and precious moment in the life of the soul. From the perspective of the soul it is a natural and deeply engaging process. It is here that a soul might go through a tunnel, take a train or see a brilliant light.
                </p>
                <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">Soul Journey</h4>
                <p class="description">
                  Every soul encounters a unique and profound journey through the Cosmos. This journey allows the soul's frequency to adjust to living in the spirit realms. It is often during this journey that a soul might wonder how he or she could have forgotten something so important.
                </p>
                <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">The Welcoming</h4>
                <p class="description">
                  Every soul is welcomed. Each welcoming is defined by the needs and wishes of the soul participating. A welcoming can be simple or complex; quiet and personal; large and celebratory; religious or non-religious. The Great Beings of Light, angels, ancestors and/or kindred spirits offer the welcoming as one being or as an entourage.
                </p>
                <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">Release of the Body</h4>
                <p class="description">
                  Great care is taken to make the completed transition as seamless as possible. When the soul is firmly established in the correct frequency for the eternal realms, the body stops breathing because it is no longer needed. Similarly, at birth, when the protection of the mother's womb is no longer required and the baby can thrive on his or her own, the umbilical cord is cut. When my mother's soul transitioned, the body stopped breathing after she was placed in the arms of a Great Being of Light. At my father's soul passage, the body stopped breathing after his soul had left our home with an entourage of Beings of Light. As with all things eternal, the process is simple and the timing is unique to each soul.

                A soul passage is among the most precious of experiences in the circle of temporary life. At first some may feel hesitant to leave earth. Yet, as we step on the path, we are embraced with the tender unfolding of the light blossoms between final repose and cosmic wonder...

                If there is any residual doubt about the profound love for humanity in the Great Beyond, it is put to rest at the welcoming. Each soul is individually welcomed in a manner that speaks deeply to his or her being. Souls are always very grateful for the thoughtfulness of this encounter and thrilled to be Home...

                <p class="description">
                  Shortly, out of the corner of my eye, I notice a large, silvery, iridescent bubble touching down beside Toby. Out steps a female to welcome her. Clearly, they are thrilled to see each other again. They embrace affectionately. When we look up, there are hundreds of these magnificent bubbles silently streaming across the brilliant blue sky. The enchanting beauty of this scene is astounding. Slowly, the other bubbles touch down one by one. Each ancestor emerges and happily hugs Toby, until the entire scene becomes a swirl of meeting and greeting, melding and intermingling color. Tremendous laughter breaks the profound silence.

                  "Yes, my dog."<br>
                  Soon, the dog in the Great Beyond bounds forth to greet his dear master. Townsend is stunned to silence.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                  A very deep wilderness with extraordinarily tall trees invites our presence. At the edge, there is a resting spot where an angel and I help Townsend sit on a simple bench. The dog is beside him. We sit in the peace of sacred silence.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                  Soon, Townsend's brother and sister-in-law emerge from the deep forest to lovingly greet Townsend. Now he is really speechless. Townsend jumps up and runs to give them a hearty hug. The knowing that has been returning bit by bit is now firmly present. This heartfelt moment is deeply etched into our memories.

                  Suddenly, gorgeous celebratory singing erupts. We see that hundreds of ancestors encircling us are joined by angelic beings, which magnify the sound tremendously. They surround us to form what looks like a tulip blossom emerging from a lotus flower. This explosion of joyous singing causes Donald to jump up to give the angel and me a most beautiful hug. We watch, mesmerized by the incredible sight before our eyes. Donald's knowing has returned. He is thrilled to be Home.

                <p class="description">
                  When the angelic music begins to fade, we find ourselves delighted to be standing out in the Cosmos joyfully emanating Light. Imagine! While our efforts could feel entirely insufficient amid such grandeur, beautiful words stream through us: "the majesty of the human form, the brilliance of the human heart, and the preciousness of the human life." As we are concentrating on the words, from a sudden burst of Light, the Christ emerges to take both of Jane's hands. It is an electrifying moment! Brilliant Star beams of Light fill the Cosmos revealing worlds, beyond worlds, beyond worlds. Jane and her entourage move slowly away appearing as One Radiant Star. I watch for a long time and give one more wave before the Star disappears.

                Souls often return to say thank you for the assistance during their soul passage. It is such a heartfelt connection to celebrate the joy of life continuing with deeply personal encounters. Souls are under no obligation to return from the Great Beyond.

                  "It is at once startling and magnificent. I wonder that we slip so easily into our new roles. The splendor far exceeds anything on earth. And yet, the joyous experience of life on earth sings at a depth that colors our return. Somehow, experiencing both here and there moves us in ways that could not otherwise be accomplished."

              <p class="description">
                Families on earth have a tremendous opportunity to see final repose through different eyes and to learn more about the soul passage that every mortal has the honor to engage. This deeper understanding may come in many ways such as feeling the deep peace of sacred silence, hearing the singing of hundreds of ancestors from the Great Beyond, or receiving a thank you from a loved one...
